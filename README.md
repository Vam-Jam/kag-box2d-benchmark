# What is this mod?

This is a small mod designed to allow me to quickly test & compare features for the new Box2d update. 

# How do I use this?

Just drop it into your Mods folder, add it to mods.cfg and set sv_gamemode to Benchmark


# What it currently does:

Stress tests:
- Doors
- Ladders
- Overlaps
- Raining Kegs (Collisions)
- Spikes (dirt)
- Spikes (stone)
- Tile spam


# Notes

Does not currently support dedicated server.

The code here is *rough* and *stupid*, the goal is just to quickly iterate different Box2d/Engine features.
